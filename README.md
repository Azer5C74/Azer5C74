## Hi, my name is Azer 👋
_______________________

✨ **Azer5C74** ✨ is a nothing but the combination of my name and Base32 encoding of first 3 letters of my family name.

- 🔭 I’m currently working as Full Stack Developer.
- 🎓 I have graduated as a Software Engineer.
- 🖥️ I have a taste for System Administration.
- 🌐 I am a digital nomad.


### Technical
______________________
- 🖼️ I'm framework agnostic. My preference is Laravel, I like Django, and I can React. (if you ask nicely you'll find some Node & knockout knowledge under the hood also).
- 💻 I dabble in dev-ops. I write GHA workflows, docker & compose (build, deploy, run), CI/CD with changesets/cli, nginx configs, Kubernetes backend services and Vercel CDN front ends.
